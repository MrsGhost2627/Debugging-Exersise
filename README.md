# Debugging Exercises – Thaija

This repository contains four debugging exercises completed as part of my coursework.  
Each exercise was originally provided with errors in pseudocode. I reviewed, tested, and corrected the logic, ensuring proper syntax, indentation, and readability.

## 🛠 Debugging Approach

For each exercise, I followed a consistent process:

1. **Review Declarations**  
   - Checked for misspelled or mismatched variable names.  
   - Ensured correct data types (e.g., numeric vs. string).  

2. **Validate Input/Output**  
   - Confirmed that every prompt (`output`) had a matching `input`.  
   - Added missing input statements where necessary.  

3. **Correct Logic**  
   - Fixed loop conditions (`<>` for not equal).  
   - Applied parentheses in calculations to ensure proper order of operations.  
   - Replaced incorrect structures (e.g., `while … else … endwhile` → `if … else … endif`).  

4. **Test with Sample Data**  
   - Ran through example inputs to confirm expected results (e.g., averages, net pay).  

5. **Improve Readability**  
   - Applied consistent indentation.  
   - Added comments explaining each section.

## 🎯 Outcomes

- All pseudocode now runs logically and produces correct results.  
- Files are cleanly formatted and ready for submission.  
- Demonstrates ability to identify errors, apply debugging strategies, and document solutions.
